## Creating an AWS Firewall Manager Rule for Auditing and Auto-Remediating Overly Permissive Security Group Rules

AWS Firewall Manager simplifies your AWS firewall administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources. This guide describes how to create a Firewall Manager rule to audit overly permissive security group rules and implement auto-remediation for noncompliant resources.

### Step 1: Prerequisites
- Ensure that AWS Firewall Manager is set up with the necessary prerequisites:
  - You must be using AWS Organizations with all features enabled.
  - Your AWS account must be the master account of your AWS Organization.
  - You should have the necessary IAM permissions to configure Firewall Manager policies.

### Step 2: Sign in to AWS Management Console
- **Access the Console**: Open your web browser and navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
- **Log in** with your AWS account credentials.

### Step 3: Navigate to AWS Firewall Manager
- Open the **Services** menu and select **Firewall Manager** under the Security, Identity, & Compliance section.

### Step 4: Create a Security Group Policy
- In the Firewall Manager dashboard, select **Security Policies**.
- Click on **Create policy**.
- Choose **Security group** as the policy type.

### Step 5: Configure the Policy
- **Policy name**: Enter a descriptive name for your policy, such as `AuditOverlyPermissiveRules`.
- **Security group rules**:
  - Define the rules that identify overly permissive configurations, such as inbound rules allowing access from `0.0.0.0/0` on sensitive ports.
  - Specify the remediation action for noncompliant security groups. Choose **Auto remediation** and define the corrective action, such as removing the overly permissive rule or modifying it to limit access.
- **Resource type**: Select the types of resources you want the policy to apply to, such as EC2 instances and elastic network interfaces.

### Step 6: Set the Policy Scope
- **Include resource tags**: Specify tags to include resources that should be monitored by this policy.
- **Exclude resource tags** (optional): Define tags for resources that should be excluded from the policy.

### Step 7: Configure Policy Settings
- **Remediation enabled**: Ensure that remediation is enabled to automatically fix noncompliant resources.
- **Notification channel**: Set up an SNS topic for notifications when noncompliance is detected or when remediation actions are taken.

### Step 8: Review and Create the Policy
- Review all settings and configurations to ensure they meet your requirements.
- Click **Create policy** to finalize the setup.
